## About Me

My journey into the world of software development began with a degree in pharmacology. However, I quickly realized that my true passion lay in the realm of software development. This epiphany came thanks to my brother-in-law, a full-stack developer, who ignited my curiosity and set me on an exciting new path.

I embarked on this new path through online research and self-guided learning, which proved to be a challenging endeavor without proper mentorship. A turning point in my journey came when I secured an internship in software development, a pivotal moment that would forever shape my career.

Over the course of a 6-month program with two different companies, I had the privilege of immersing myself in the diverse facets of software development. Working alongside cross-functional teams, I gained invaluable insights and hands-on experience.

Today, I'm entering a new chapter in my journey, having enrolled in a 4-month bootcamp course to further enhance my skills. This journey has been marked by perseverance, adaptability, and a relentless drive to excel in the field of software development. I am excited to continue expanding my horizons and contributing to the ever-evolving world of technology.
